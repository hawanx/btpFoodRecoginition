# Fruit and Vegetable detection for Automatic Harvesting

The use of robotic technology and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to automate agricultural activities has attracted a lot of attention recently. Fruits typically develop in uncertain, complex conditions. Intelligent agriculture and automated harvesting require robust fruit vision detecting systems.

The capacity to precisely identify and evaluate the nutritional value of fruits and vegetables is crucial in the current era of health consciousness. The goal of this project is to create an intelligent system that can identify various fruits and vegetables from photos and provide detailed nutritional information by using deep learning techniques.

### MobileNet V2
MobileNet is a simple but efficient and not very computationally intensive convolutional neural networks for mobile vision applications. MobileNet is widely used in many real-world applications which includes object detection, fine-grained classifications, face attributes, and localization.

MobileNetV2 introduces a new CNN layer, the inverted residual and linear bottleneck layer, enabling high accuracy/performance in mobile and embedded vision applications. The new layer builds on the depth-wise separable convolutions introduced in MobileNetV1. The MobileNetV2 network is built around this new layer and can be adapted to perform object classification and detection, and semantic segmentation.

## Conclusion.
Agricultural methods have been completely transformed by machine learning, especially deep learning, which has improved activities like fruit identification and automated harvesting. The numerous issues that climate change presents to agriculture have been greatly aided by the incorporation of ML and DL in agro climatic studies. ML expertise is made more accessible and democratized through the use of Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) frameworks, which also improve the scalability and adaptability of research.
